Yesterday was the 4th of July and I felt less than patriotic and not celebratory at all. The testimony of Shaye Moss an election worker in Georgia and her mother affectionately known as Lady Ruby has stuck with me. 

Shaye Moss loved her job as an election worker. You could see it in her demeanor when she spoke about all the good she had done over the years helping people vote. There is a special joy when your occupation gives you a sense of purpose and contribution. Only some of us get to feel that way about our jobs. To have that stripped away from Shaye because of politics and one man's narcissistic hunger is so unfair and un-American. Lady Ruby summed it up best with her statement about the President of the United States is supposed to be for all of us. I will have to go back to get her exact words but she stated it so simply. 

When Lady Ruby testified about losing her name I was crying. I just can't fathom what this family has gone through and what they have lost. When Shaye spoke about people barging into her grandmothers house looking for her and her mother to make a citizens arrest I was horrified. That was reminiscent of Jim Crow South lynching. The three generations of women who were so proud of their right to vote are not broken and scared. I really hate it here right now in my country. What are we doing? The voting rights of African Americans should be scared at this point. The fight and struggle to get those rights is the American story I am proud of and want to celebrate on the 4th of July. I really hope we can right this ship and strengthen our democracy. I want Lady Ruby to get her name back!

The whole conspiracy surrounding election fraud in Georgia surrounds these two women. On the night of the election all the election workers and volunteers thought they were done. That all the boxes of votes had been opened, processed, and counted. Folks packed up and were geting ready to leave when a box was found that had not been processed. Everyone present took off their coats and got back to work. Perhaps a little begrudingly because this all occured pretty late in the night. Lady Ruby handed her daughter Shaye a ginger mint as they were settling back in to do the important work of counting votes on an election night. All this was on video because that is one of the measures taken to ensure that elections are transparent. This video clip of a mother passing her daughter a little piece of candy was digested and spewed back out as proof that election fraud had occured. Their names were denegrated by the President of the United States without hesitation. The President of the United States called these two women out by name with out any proof, without any regard for their safety. The mob of Trump supporters descended on them with a vengenace. All over a damn ginger mint!
