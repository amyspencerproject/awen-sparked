I knew it might happen. Then there was the leaked draft of the opinion and I knew it was going to happen. But when it did happen I was still shook. Seeing the headlines that Roe was overturned was hard for me to wrap my brain around. I do my best to not vilify the people on the other side of this political and religious issue. I pity them because I think they have been duped. I think it is lazy to base so many of your political and societal choices on one issue. 

Billy Graham could have called white evangelicals to a national repentance. He could have joined arm and arm with Dr Martin Luther King Jr and declared racism in all its pernicious forms to be un-Christlike. He could have changed our national discourse and healed some of the cultural divisions in America. But he did not. Instead he asked white evangelical christians to focus on two issues, abortion and homosexuality. He gave them all a spiritual pass to not ask any hard internal questions. He let them other women and queer people and not take a hard look in the mirror at what their privilege had cost their souls. Then he made a deal with the politicians and further solidified his flock into a voting base. As the world changed evangelicals hunkered down and turn their eyes from the reality that the rest of us grappled with. In their world issues were black and white with no gray. Any uncomfortable feelings are either prayed away or explained away as the work of the devil. Evangelicals voted and funded political campaigns and made themselves feel like God was on their side.

This week we also heard Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers in his testimony before the Jan 6th hearings, proclaim that â€œIt is a tenet of my faith that the Constitution is divinely inspired ..." Congressman Bowers is LDS and mormons have long held the view that the US Constitution were divinely inspired. I found it chilling when he stated this out loud. A divinely inspired document cannot be updated, amended, and transformed. In my view the US constitution is a living document that needs to be modernized. It is not scripture!

The supreme court packed with conservative justices just took away the rights of women, weakened Miranda rights, and ruled down New York's gun laws which have been on the books for 100 plus years. They did rule in favor of allowing a football couch to lead prayers for a high school football team disregarding the separation of church and state. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the majority opinion that overturned Roe that the rulings by the Supreme Court in Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell were "demonstrably erroneous decisions". They are coming for our birth control, our right to have a private sex life, and the right to marriage equality. This feels like the death of our democracy.
