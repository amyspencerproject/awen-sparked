I sometimes think I forgot to grow up

Clapped my hands with glee to eat a hot dog in Paris

Got lost on the way back home cause of flowers and deer and sunshine

Burst into tears cause I can't call Mom to tell her ALL the things 

can't cause she is dead

ran fast, so fast down the dirt road 

so fast I forgot my body was here 

Still look for golden approval from adults

whoever they are

Just want to be special and the class pet

Just want to make you laugh so you don't get mad or sad or die

Never seen a fire alarm I didn't want to pull

Never seen an edge I didn't want to lean over 

feel my soul flutter in my chest 

cause its a long way down 

what a ride that would be to the end

I still enjoy feeling joy

so everything will be as it should be
