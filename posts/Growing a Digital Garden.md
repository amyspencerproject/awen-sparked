Many people start a blog and then let it wither away. I have done this twice online. The structure and my perfectionism always prevent me from maintaining a blog. This time I am going to try a digital garden approach.

Digital Garden Goals
--------------

### 1\. Contribute 

Being a lifelong learner I think about a lot of things! I am afraid to share them for various reasons. However, I think it is so important to contribute to a community, to the common good, to a wider conversation. When you have a digital garden you are sigining up to be a public learner.


### 2\. Become a better writer

Nothing would make me happier that to have this garden become a weekly ritual for writing. There are times I feel such an urge to write but I feel rusty. There is no better way to polish up those skills than to just write.

### 3\. Create a repository of ideas

There are topics, dilemas, paradoxes, and problems I have been lugging around in my head for years. This garden could be a repository for all these which I could easily revist. A digital garden is not structured in chronological order but contextual relationships, linking posts by topics and themes. This seems like a much more organic way of organizing a blog.
