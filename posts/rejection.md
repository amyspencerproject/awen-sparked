Did you know that rejection lights up the same places in the brain that actual physical pain does? It really does hurt us when we are rejected. I like to think about how this played out when our ancestors were hunter-gathers, when they were living in small villages and compare it to the current modern time. 

If you were rejected from the your band of fellow hunter-gathers that could have seriously meant death. A major factor of humans surviving and thriving is our ability to work together in community. Rejection could have meant less food, less calories, and more chance of injury. When you think about rejection in a more sedentary village setting rejection could also mean death but maybe not in such dire terms.  Unless you were thrown out during a siege or forced to travel on dangerous roads to some other foreign region you were probably going to survive in the immediate. Rejection could mean social isolation and loneliness. Maybe you wouldn't have access to medical care or market goods. You might not have political protection and may end up the scapegoat for any number of grievances that come up in villages. That could actually get you killed either by the sate or by a mob. Both of these scenarios that our ancestors could have faced would be good reason for our brains to register pain when being rejected. 

That brings us to our modern era where we are so interconnect and yet simultaneously more isolated than humans maybe have ever been. We exist in our little social media bubbles guided by algorithms to never face others with differing opinions or lived experiences. Constantly connected but oceans apart from one another. And how does the pain of rejection protect us now?
