I love to trace the origins of idioms and sayings. I do not particularly care for the idiom "Patience is a virtue" but a quick search on its origins are of interest. According to Wikipedia the furtherest back source is *Psychomachia* a medieval allegory by the poet **Prudentius** written in the early 5th century. In the text there is a battle between good and evil with the virtues fighting and beating the vices. Patience enrages Wrath to the point that Wrath kills herself. 

I think I might add this to my reading list.
