I was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. My parents were ex-Mormon oddballs who didn't own a TV, loved being in the desert, and tried on a lot of religious hats. My Dad had a slowly progressing disease that caused dementia and physical decline. I am never sure when I lost the actual man or maybe I never did because in his last years there was nothing but the core of who he was left. He was loving and kind. Growing up I loved punk rock and classical music and I couldn't wait to leave Utah. I met David when I was just 18 years old. He was so cute and had such a kind smile so 10 years later we got married. Of course, we left Utah and moved to Colorado.

I got a chemistry degree from Fort Lewis College which eventually lead me back to Utah for graduate school. I helped take care of my Dad until he finally slipped away. I moved to Italy and studied synthetic biology for four years. What an experience! I came back to Colorado and helped start a marijuana testing lab. That was also an experience! 

When Trump was elected I went back to church settling on being an Episcopalian. When Covid hit my world changed drastically. I changed careers and took care of my Mom before she passed away. The dust and the grief are still settling on the last few years. I am still here with my feet on the ground, just hanging out with David and seeing what the next chapter holds for me.
