This is my personal blog

## Static Site 

This site was built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) a static site generator.  I used an awesome Eleventy boiler plate created by [Dan Urbanowicz](https://github.com/danurbanowicz) which deploys to [Netifly CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). This makes it easy to add quick content while also allowing me to develop all the bells and whistles locally.
